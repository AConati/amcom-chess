This project is a joint effort by Natalia Orbach-Mandel, Ari Conati, and Marco Conati to recreate the Deepmind Alphazero paper from libraries in python. The chess engine is based on python-chess, and neural net is built using Pytorch!

As a pandemic project, this was meant to be a learning experience for all of us. The code is not very organized, and names are silly, but we all learned and had fun!
